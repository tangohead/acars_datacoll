# Get current date, check if we have a database for it
# If we do, use that as the current DB
# If not, generate a new db name

# Boot up the ACARS decoder

# Boot up the ACARS server

# Wake up parent at midnight
#   Add the past days DB name to some log
#   Start the servers with the new log


## Might it be easier interface with the DB and just clear the entries?
